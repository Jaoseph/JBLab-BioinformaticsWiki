# Transferring Files - Cluster EDITION

##### *"Whether you’re finding or moving plots, scripts, data files, navigating these between these can feel like untangling old Christmas lights.*

## **Where Are We Moving Files?**

You’ll often be transferring between **three main locations**:

| Location          | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `Local machine`   | Work Laptop or One-drive (e.g. **one-drive**)
| `HPC cluster`     | The compute cluster (e.g. **clust1-sub-1**)
| `Institute Drive` | Shared institute storage (e.g. **I-drive/nas-data**)
| `FTP server`      | File Transfer Protocol (e.g. **ftpserver**)


Depending on your specific needs, you might:


### ↑ Upload

- **Local Machine → HPC Cluster**
- **Institute Drive (NAS) → HPC Cluster**

### ↓ Download

- **HPC Cluster → Local Machine**
- **HPC Cluster → Institute Drive (NAS)**

> This guide helps you move across all three — reliably and with minimal frustration.
